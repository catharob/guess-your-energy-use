# Guess Your Energy Use

This is a work-in-progress interactive feature for [Inside Energy](insideenergy.org). 

#### Current Goal

Highcharts and Google Charts are confounding me. Will now try to make simple visualizations with jQuery methods. 

#### Status

Have successfully created div that responds to input. Now need to finesse a bit to make responsive, and stack different input divs next to each other. Will require float, I believe.
