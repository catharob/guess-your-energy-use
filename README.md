# Guess Your Energy Use

This is a work-in-progress interactive feature for [Inside Energy](insideenergy.org). 

#### Current Problem

Highchart won't appear on `thankyou.html` page. 

Used code almost verbatim from here: http://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/jquery/1.7.2/highslide-software/highcharts.com/tree/master/samples/highcharts/data/google-spreadsheet/

Added jquery script before highcharts scripts. 

Added chart type (bar) in `script2.js`, and left out `pre` tag in html.

Changed Google Sheets key to sheet I'm trying to import. 

Error message looks like this:
